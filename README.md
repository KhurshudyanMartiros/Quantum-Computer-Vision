# Quantum Computer Vision

Quantum machine learning, where quantum computing is applied to machine learning tasks, has attracted much attention in recent years [1-3]. The role of quantum machine learning in computer vision appears promising, but further research and effort are needed to overcome issues such as increasing model accuracy. A clear advantage of quantum models over classical deep learning and machine learning models is not clearly seen in available sources. The quanvolutional neural network, known as QNN and proposed in [4], is one model that is the subject of our research (see also [5], [6], [7]).

Given the current state of the field and potential applications of Quantum Computer Vision Models in healthcare, security, and algo trading, among others, we are initiating research with the main goal of addressing the field's defined issues.

At this stage of work, the main goals are:

1) Develop novel quantum pre-processing filters to enhance image classification accuracy using Grover's search circuits.

2) Establish a solid research line to explore its connection with data loading and reloading approaches, and how it can improve classification accuracy.

The list of tasks will be systematically updated and expanded, with crucial research results shared in hopes of transforming this repository into a useful tutorial for students, researchers, and practitioners with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
